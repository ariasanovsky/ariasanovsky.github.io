## This tower is crooked

<img height = "300px" src="/self/crooked-Ghirlandina-tower.jpg" />

I'm not sure the photo does it justice.
It was disorienting.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torre_della_Ghirlandina) doesn't mention the bizarre angle. 
The WHC mentions its preservation loosely in their [article](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/827) on its UNESCO status.
Oddly, [this one Trip Advisor review](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187803-d2394402-r576854173-Ghirlandina-Modena_Province_of_Modena_Emilia_Romagna.html) was the first page I could find that explicitly mentions its tilt!
Maybe [dirt](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276461120_Identification_Technique_for_Soil-Structure_Analysis_of_the_Ghirlandina_Tower) is to blame.
