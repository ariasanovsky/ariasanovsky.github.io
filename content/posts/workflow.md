## finally a real Spring

What fantastic weather. What a cathartic run. Angus loved the view from the window and skittered all around the house in excitement.

## Today I have been thinking about

- our tech stack: what does modern code look like? how can I help without overstepping?
- workflow:
  - would be hilarious to incorporate a [FOSS LLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StMP7g-0wK4) into an app
  - I saw some of the [dfdx work stream](https://www.twitch.tv/corelo1) and try CoPilot
  - improving module structure and error-gonomics for more maintainability
  - [plagiarize the standard library](https://towardsdatascience.com/nine-rules-for-creating-fast-safe-and-compatible-data-structures-in-rust-part-1-c0973092e0a3) when designing your API
  - what's the best way to strap together run-and-tests apps for CI/CT/CD?
- projects:
  - how much time can I commit to MCTS Ramsey?
  - should I try to help with dfdx?
- design patterns:
  - `Result<Option<T>>` is neat
  - `try_into` factories
  - custom iterators
- growth:
  - how does interest become collaboration?
  - how do I know when work is done?
  - if I ask for more, what do I get in return?

## Do I enjoy regular expressions... too much

??? Jury's still out.
